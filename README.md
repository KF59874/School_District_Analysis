# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
This analysis has been conducted to see how different schools within a school district perform based on their students' results in standardized testing in Math and Reading. The results have been gathered using the marks in standardized testing. 

The schools have then been compared based on capita per student (spending per student), school size (small, medium, large) and the type of school (Charter or District). 

Due to potential dishonesty during the standardized testing at *Thomas High School*, the analysis had to be performed a second time around, at which point the test results for grade 9 students at *Thomas High School* have been omitted to create more accurate results.
